a.	Using Semaphores

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
#include <unistd.h>

sem_t mutex, db; ////mutex for readCount updation and db for accessing shared resource
int readCount = 0;

void *reader(void *arg) {
    int reader_id = *(int *)arg;

    // Reader trying to read
    printf("Reader %d is trying to read...\n", reader_id);
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    readCount++;
    if (readCount == 1) {
        sem_wait(&db);
    }
    sem_post(&mutex);

    // Reading data
    printf("Reader %d is reading...\n", reader_id);
    sleep(1);

    // Reader leaving
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    readCount--;
    if (readCount == 0) {
        sem_post(&db);
    }
    sem_post(&mutex);

    printf("Reader %d is leaving...\n", reader_id);
    sleep(1);

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

void *writer(void *arg) {
    int writer_id = *(int *)arg;

    // Writer trying to write
    printf("Writer %d is trying to write...\n", writer_id);
    sem_wait(&db);

    // Writing data
    printf("Writer %d is writing data...\n", writer_id);
    sleep(1);

    // Writer leaving after writing
    sem_post(&db);

    printf("Writer %d is leaving...\n", writer_id);
    sleep(1);

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main() {
    pthread_t readers[2], writers[2];
    int reader_ids[2] = {1, 2};
    int writer_ids[2] = {1, 2};

    sem_init(&mutex, 0, 1);
    sem_init(&db, 0, 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        pthread_create(&readers[i], NULL, reader, &reader_ids[i]);
        pthread_create(&writers[i], NULL, writer, &writer_ids[i]);
    }

    // Let the threads run for a while
    sleep(16);

    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        pthread_cancel(readers[i]);
        pthread_cancel(writers[i]);
        pthread_join(readers[i], NULL);
        pthread_join(writers[i], NULL);
    }

    sem_destroy(&mutex);
    sem_destroy(&db);

    return 0;
}

Output:
Reader 1 is trying to read...
Reader 1 is reading...
Writer 2 is trying to write...
Writer 1 is trying to write...
Reader 2 is trying to read...
Reader 2 is reading...
Reader 2 is leaving...

b.	 Using Mutexes

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_mutex_t db;
int readCount = 0;

void *reader(void *arg) {
    int reader_id = *(int *)arg;

    // Reader trying to read
    printf("Reader %d is trying to read...\n", reader_id);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    readCount++;
    if (readCount == 1) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&db);
    }
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    // Reading data
    printf("Reader %d is reading...\n", reader_id);
    sleep(1);

    // Reader leaving
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    readCount--;
    if (readCount == 0) {
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&db);
    }
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    printf("Reader %d is leaving...\n", reader_id);
    sleep(1);

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

void *writer(void *arg) {
    int writer_id = *(int *)arg;

    // Writer trying to write
    printf("Writer %d is trying to write...\n", writer_id);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&db);

    // Writing data
    printf("Writer %d is writing data...\n", writer_id);
    sleep(1);

    // Writer leaving after writing
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&db);

    printf("Writer %d is leaving...\n", writer_id);
    sleep(1);

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main() {
    pthread_t readers[2], writers[2];
    int reader_ids[2] = {1, 2};
    int writer_ids[2] = {1, 2};

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        pthread_create(&readers[i], NULL, reader, &reader_ids[i]);
        pthread_create(&writers[i], NULL, writer, &writer_ids[i]);
    }

    // Let the threads run for a while
    sleep(10);

    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        pthread_cancel(readers[i]);
        pthread_cancel(writers[i]);
        pthread_join(readers[i], NULL);
        pthread_join(writers[i], NULL);
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:

Reader 1 is reading...
Reader 2 is trying to read...
Reader 2 is reading...
Writer 2 is trying to write...
Writer 1 is trying to write...
Reader 1 is leaving...
Reader 2 is leaving...
Writer 2 is writing data...
